  abstract = {In recent years, calibrated energy modeling of residential and commercial buildings has gained importance in a retrofit-dominated market. Accurate weather data play an important role in this calibration process and projected energy savings. It would be ideal to measure weather data at the building location to capture relevant microclimate variation but this is generally considered cost-prohibitive. There are data sources publicly available with high temporal sampling rates but at relatively poor geospatial sampling locations. To overcome this limitation, there are a growing number of service providers that claim to provide real time and historical weather data necessary for building modeling at 15\textendash 40km2 grid across the globe; common variables such as temperature and precipitation have been constructed on {$\sim$}1km2 grids [1]. Unfortunately, there is limited documentation from 3rd-party sources attesting to the accuracy of this data. This paper compares provided weather characteristics with data collected from a weather station inaccessible to the service providers. Monthly average dry bulb temperature; relative humidity; direct normal, diffuse and global solar radiation; wind speed and wind direction are statistically compared. Moreover, we ascertain the relative contribution of each weather variable and its impact on building loads. Annual simulations are performed for three different building types, including a closely monitored and automated energy efficient research building. The comparison shows that the difference for an individual variable can be as high as 90\%. In addition, annual building energy consumption can vary by {$\pm$}7\% while monthly building loads can vary by {$\pm$}40\% as a function of the provided location's weather data.},

Such analyses and future predictions are imperative to allow decision-makers and stakeholders to accomplish climate-resilient and sustainable development goals by leveraging the power of meaningful and trustworthy projections and insights. We demonstrated that the XAI is capable of predicting the Ec under future climate scenarios with high accuracy (R2{$>$}0.9) and reveals the critical inflection points of the daily average outdoor air temperature (Ta) beyond which the Ec increase exponentially. We applied the XAI model for residential and commercial buildings in hot\textendash humid and mixed\textendash humid climate regions to quantify the incremental impacts of climate change on Ec under the different SSPs. The XAI-based analysis concluded positive and persistent incremental changes in the Ec from 2020 to 2100 under all future SSP scenarios, with the maximum incremental impact of 24.5\%, 33.3\%, 57.8\%, and 87.2\% in hot\textendash humid and 37.1\%, 47.5\%, 85.3\%, and 121\% in mixed\textendash humid climate regions under the sustainable green energy (SSP126), business-as-usual (SSP245), challenges to adaptation (SSP370), and increased reliance on fossil fuels (SSP585) scenarios, respectively. Potential increases in the Ec in future climates could have significant adverse impacts on the local and regional economy if necessary adaptation and mitigation measures are not implemented a priori.},

  abstract = {Weather files provide hourly times series of weather variables for a typical year based on historical observations, and are widely used for modeling energy use and human comfort in the built environment. However, since they are based on historical data, they are increasingly inaccurate tools for estimating the future performance of buildings and communities, especially those with lifetimes exceeding 30 years. A ``morphing'' technique [1] has been used to transform historical time series based on projected changes in the monthly averages of several climatic variables. Since future values of these variables are uncertain, especially at local scales, changes in the monthly mean value of each of the variables, or offsets, have been calculated for an ensemble of climate projections generated by models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). These models were run for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment (AR5). The offsets were calculated for several future time periods during the 21st century for both the 4.5 and 8.5 Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). For each combination of time period and RCP, a cumulative frequency distribution (CFD) of the offset in mean monthly temperature was constructed based on the percentile rankings of the projections in the ensemble. The association between the mean monthly temperature and the other variables for each model is maintained, providing a consistent and physically plausible set of inputs to the morphing algorithm for each point on the CFD. The Weather File Module of the WeatherShift\texttrademark{} tool provides an intuitive user interface that allows the user to select a location, emissions scenario, future time period and point on the CFD to obtain a projected weather file reflecting a plausible future climate.},

This paper investigates the generation of climate change adapted simulation weather data for locations worldwide from readily available data sets. An approach is presented for `morphing' existing EnergyPlus/ESP-r Weather (EPW) data with UK Met Office Hadley Centre general circulation model (GCM) predictions for a `medium\textendash high' emissions scenario (A2). It was found that, for the United Kingdom (UK), the GCM `morphed' data shows a smoothing effect relative to data generated from the corresponding regional climate model (RCM) outputs. This is confirmed by building performance simulations of a naturally ventilated UK office building which highlight a consistent temperature distribution profile between GCM and RCM `morphed' data, yet with a shift in the distribution. It is demonstrated that, until more detailed RCM data becomes available globally, `morphing' with GCM data can be considered as a viable interim approach to generating climate change adapted weather data.},

  abstract = {Patterns of future climate and expected extreme conditions are pushing design limits as recognition of climate change and its implication for the built environment increases. There are a number of ways of estimating future climate projections and creating weather files. Obtaining adequate representation of long-term patterns of climate change and extreme conditions is, however, challenging. This work aims at answering two research questions: does a method of generating future weather files for building performance simulation bring advantages that cannot be provided by other methods? And what type of future weather files enable building engineers and designers to more credibly test robustness of their designs against climate change? To answer these two questions, the work provides an overview of the major approaches to create future weather data sets based on the statistical and dynamical downscaling of climate models. A number of weather data sets for Geneva were synthesized and applied to the energy simulation of 16 ASHRAE standard reference buildings, single buildings and their combination to create a virtual neighborhood. Representative weather files are synthesized to account for extreme conditions together with typical climate conditions and investigate their importance in the energy performance of buildings. According to the results, all the methods provide enough information to study the long-term impacts of climate change on average. However, the results also revealed that assessing the energy robustness of buildings only under typical future conditions is not sufficient. Depending on the type of building, the relative change of peak load for cooling demand under near future extreme conditions can still be up to 28.5\% higher compared to typical conditions. It is concluded that only those weather files generated based on dynamical downscaling and that take into consideration both typical and extreme conditions are the most reliable for providing representative boundary conditions to test the energy robustness of buildings under future climate uncertainties. The results for the neighborhood explaining the critical situation that an energy network may face due to increased peak load under extreme climatic conditions. Such critical situations remain unforeseeable by relying solely on typical and observed extreme conditions, putting the climate resilience of buildings and energy systems at risk.},

The Scenario Model Intercomparison Project (ScenarioMIP) is the primary activity within Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) that will provide multi-model climate projections based on alternative scenarios of future emissions and land use changes produced with integrated assessment models. In this paper, we describe ScenarioMIP's objectives, experimental design, and its relation to other activities within CMIP6. The ScenarioMIP design is one component of a larger scenario process that aims to facilitate a wide range of integrated studies across the climate science, integrated assessment modeling, and impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability communities, and will form an important part of the evidence base in the forthcoming Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessments. At the same time, it will provide the basis for investigating a number of targeted science and policy questions that are especially relevant to scenario-based analysis, including the role of specific forcings such as land use and aerosols, the effect of a peak and decline in forcing, the consequences of scenarios that limit warming to below 2 \textdegree C, the relative contributions to uncertainty from scenarios, climate models, and internal variability, and long-term climate system outcomes beyond the 21st century. To serve this wide range of scientific communities and address these questions, a design has been identified consisting of eight alternative 21st century scenarios plus one large initial condition ensemble and a set of long-term extensions, divided into two tiers defined by relative priority. Some of these scenarios will also provide a basis for variants planned to be run in other CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs to investigate questions related to specific forcings. Harmonized, spatially explicit emissions and land use scenarios generated with integrated assessment models will be provided to participating climate modeling groups by late 2016, with the climate model simulations run within the 2017\textendash 2018 time frame, and output from the climate model projections made available and analyses performed over the 2018\textendash 2020 period.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Zero-net-energy (ZNE) homes produce an adequate amount of energy on-site to meet their energy demand based on source energy for an entire year. California building energy efficiency standards require new residential buildings started in 2020 to be ZNE. For various reasons, a home designed as ZNE may not achieve ZNE performance in real operation. This study aimed to quantify the robustness of the energy performance of ZNE homes due to weather variability, climate change, and the uncertainty of occupant behavior. A single-family ZNE house, based on the optimal cost-effective design in three California climate zones, was used to develop the EnergyPlus simulation models. Weather variations were considered from a combination of the historical 30~years' actual meteorological year (AMY) weather data, typical year weather data in TMY3, and future weather data based on Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scenarios. Three scenarios of occupant behavior from the energy perspective were defined to represent the uncertainty about occupants' activities, comfort requirements, and their adaptive interactions with buildings and systems. In terms of annual source energy, the simulation results of the ZNE homes showed: (1) a decrease of 23\textendash 38 percent for occupants with energy austerity behavior and an increase of 120\textendash 130 percent for occupants with energy wasteful behavior, compared with the baseline assumption of normal occupants; (2) a variation range of -15 percent to +14 percent for the results using 30-year AMY weather data compared with the baseline results using TMY3 weather data; (3) an increase of 10\textendash 13 percent with future weather in Fresno and Riverside and a decrease of 15 percent with San Francisco; and (4) climate change can reduce the gap between the austerity and wasteful consumption. These findings provide insights into how ZNE homes may perform in reality and inform architects, engineers, occupants, and policymakers to pay more attention to occupant behavior on design, operation, and regulations of ZNE homes to ensure energy performance robustness.},

The research uses Boston, Miami and San Francisco as diverse cities representing different climate challenges and to study regional effects on complete long-term energy use in future scenarios. The most recent climate projections from the IPCC and UKCP09 are compared with historic projections to understand how variances in algorithms alter building energy use over time. The comparison of energy simulations using `morphed' weather files under different methodologies, current climate forecasts and adjusted emissions scenarios are visualized and discussed to demonstrate the impact of climate change on building energy consumption.
