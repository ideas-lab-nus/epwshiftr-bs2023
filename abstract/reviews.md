Review 1
========

Comments for the Authors
------------------------

The authors propose a paper on  presenting epwshiftr which creates future
'EnergyPlus' weather files using the latest 'CMIP6' Data. This is a relatively
new R package that is already opened sourced so the community can interface it
with the eplusr package.

I look forward to a more detailed description how the authors determined the
morphing EPW weather variables.

Highly recommend this abstract for a paper.

Comments for the Authors
------------------------

This abstract falls within the scope of  thematic session on Weather & climate
adaptation. Epwshiftr is an interesting tool to project weather files into the
future. However, the main references appear obsolete, there is a lot of
bibliography on the subject. I encourage authors to refer to the most recent
findings on this issue in the final paper. There is no mention of bias
correction in the abstract, so it is not clear whether the tools also implement
this feature to reduce erro, if itis not implemented a comment about the it
should be added. I encourage the authors to also include some comments on
existing data generation tools, highlighting the differences and especially the
improvements of Epwshiftr over those tools.

Comments for the Authors
------------------------

Seems very interesting study. Please make sure to add in the full paper a brief
overview of the different types of generating future weather data and clearly
highlight how the new approach is different from all other approaches.
